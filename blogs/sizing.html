        <h1>What is px vs rem vs em...</h1>

        <div>
            Devs starting with web development always get confused when to use px rem or em.<br>
            Let me simplify before diving deep into the topic, px, rem, and em are just units of messurement in pixels.<br><br>
            
            If just it's just pixels then why other fancy unit viz rem and em, and not just px.<br><br>
            
            It is because world is messed up and we have different screens with different pixel density. Therefore if I define a gap of 10 px between letters, then screen A with pixel density of 10px/inch will show an inch gap between characters vs screen B with pixel density of 20px/inch will show a gap of half inch between characters.<br><br>

            We have a problem here, our gap between elements(characters) dont change with the screen resolution. To solve the problem we use a releative unit of messurement which is not dependent on the pixel density of the screen but is dependent on the size of font we use.<br><br>

            <h2>Introducing REM</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                REM stands for root element and is a unit that is multiple of font size.
                Therefore, 1rem = 1(font unit of the font of root element)<br><br>

                Example:<br>
                Font size of root element is 14px.<br>
                Then, 1rem = 14px<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2rem = 28px<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3rem = 42px<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                In the above example, if you observe I use "root element" font size. So, the sizing will be dependent on the root element's font size.
                To make sizing dependent on the size of the element's size we use <strong>EM</strong>.
